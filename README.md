# Call Center Trends Dashboard

## Overview

This repository contains a Power BI dashboard that provides insights into key performance indicators (KPIs) related to call center operations. The dashboard is designed to help call center managers and stakeholders understand trends in call handling, agent performance, and customer satisfaction.

## Features

### 1. **Call Volume and Efficiency**
   - **Total Calls Answered**: Displays the total number of calls answered over the selected period.
   - **Average Speed of Answer (ASA)**: Shows the average time it takes for an agent to answer a call.
   - **Average Talk Duration**: Measures the average duration of calls handled by agents.

### 2. **Agent Performance**
   - **Calls Answered by Agent**: Visualizes the distribution of calls answered by each agent, helping identify high performers.
   - **Calls Abandoned by Agent**: Shows the number of calls abandoned per agent, indicating where improvements might be needed.
   - **Average Handle Time by Agent**: Tracks the average time each agent spends handling calls, providing insights into efficiency and effectiveness.

### 3. **Customer Satisfaction**
   - **Overall Customer Satisfaction**: Displays the average customer satisfaction rating based on the feedback collected after calls.
   - **Total Calls by Satisfaction Rating**: Breaks down the number of calls by different satisfaction ratings, helping to identify trends in customer sentiment.

### 4. **Resolved Calls**
   - **Total Resolved Calls**: Shows the number of calls that were successfully resolved, providing a measure of service effectiveness.

## Key Insights

- **Agent Performance Variability**: There is variability in performance among agents, with some handling more calls with lower abandonment rates than others.
- **Satisfaction Correlation**: There is a noticeable correlation between call handling metrics (e.g., speed of answer, handle time) and customer satisfaction ratings.
- **High Abandonment Rates**: Certain agents have higher call abandonment rates, which could be affecting overall customer satisfaction and should be addressed.

## Recommendations

1. **Performance Coaching**: Consider implementing targeted coaching for agents with higher abandonment rates or longer handle times to improve overall efficiency.
2. **Focus on Speed of Answer**: Reducing the average speed of answer could lead to improved customer satisfaction, as quicker response times are typically associated with higher satisfaction ratings.
3. **Customer Feedback Analysis**: Further analyze the relationship between call handling metrics and satisfaction ratings to identify specific areas for improvement.
